SING THIS

Angel Wings
Mike Ault

You were perfection, I was a mess
I lacked emotion, you did your best
I was behind you through every step
You lost your way and you fell instead
Fell instead, fell instead, fell instead
Fell instead, fell instead, fell instead
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
I never told you I could give it all away
I never begged you or held you down, down to stay
I lacked contentment, you longed for joy
But your resentment, it was ploy
I lacked contentment, you longed for joy
But your resentment, but it was all a ploy
Give me angels' wings
Give me angels' wings
Give me angels' wings
Give me angels' wings
Give me angels' wings
Give me angels' wings
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
Angels' wings, angels' wings, angels' wings
Bring me down, bring me back to earth
Bring me down, bring me back to earth
Bring me down, bring me back to earth
Bring me down, bring me back to earth
See the dark within me
(Bring me down, bring me back to earth)
The act that I rehearse
(Bring me down, bring me back to earth)
All your devotion makes your heart so sick
For my wings are merely paper in the wind
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
Up in the clouds, way above the sky
I watched you foolishly, imagined I could fly
Above the voices, denial that they bring
You made the choice to give me angels' wings
Angels' wings, wings
Angels' wings
Angels' wings
Angels' wings
I can fly, well, I can fly
I can fly, I can fly
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes
